    "response": "Wireless Earbuds in January with amount of $125.98, ID: ITM001\n\n\nUsing deductive logic and proof by exhaustion, we'll start by calculating the average sales amount per transaction for each product.\n- For MongoDB data, it's 125.98 / 1 = $125.98\n- For MySQL data, it\u2019s 159.98 / 2 = $79.99\nAs such, it appears from these calculations that the product with highest average sales amount is from the MySQL database. \n\nUsing inductive logic to narrow down the results to a single product: we know from our question that the query doesn't specify which product we're looking for, and as such there isn\u2019t enough information provided within the data to reach any conclusions about other products. Therefore, it would be impossible for us to definitively answer the user's query with certainty without additional information. \n\nAnswer: From the given data, we can only logically conclude that based on the current data, the product from the MySQL database has the highest average sales amount per transaction (i.e., $79.99). The question does not specify which product to focus on, therefore it's impossible to give a conclusive answer without more information about the specific products or time frame in which they were sold.",
